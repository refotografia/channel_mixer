<h5>This is one of 3 apps that I have created recently. I have been investigating in<br>
programming for so long, but never really got into doing it. Life took its turns, <br>
and I was presented with a chance to explore deeper into it and refresh some couple<br>
decades old knowlodge on image processing.</h5>
<h1>The Channel Mixer!</h1>

<h5>This is inspired on very old scanners that would do three captures in order to get a color image. <br>
  A few years ago I managed to get one of these working and I played with the idea of moving the <br>
  document to be scanned between the captures, while it was changing its color filters.</h5>

<h5>So this a simple app in Python, PyQT, PIL and Numpy to take advantage of how easy it is to move<br>
  channels around with Numpy.<br><br>
You need choose 3 images to start with. Either 3 color images or 3 monochromatic images.<br>
Soon I'll create another mode to shuffle channels in a single image and also to create<br>
monochromatic images with a single channel of a color image.</h5>
